# Security

## Data Handling
- Never store, request, or echo secrets, credentials, or PCI data.
- Use masked identifiers in examples and fixtures.

## Logging
- Logs must be redaction-safe and avoid sensitive identifiers.

## Access
- Treat governance changes as high-trust operations; require CODEOWNERS review.
